## Introduction

This is just a tiny bit of code, but it was starting to get duplicated around a bunch of projects, so now there's twig.

It's got an XML file for configuring the formatter -- if anyone has figured out how to do this in code, I'd love a pointer or a PR ;-)


## Usage

Add to your ``project.clj``:

```clj
[twig "0.1.0-dev"]
```

Then in a namespace of your choice add ``(: require [twig.core :as logger)`` which will allow you do not only see nicely formatted log output (as configured in the included ``resources/logback.xml`` file), but also do things like setting the log level on a per-namespace basis:

```clj
(logger/set-level! [com.datastax.driver
                    co.paralleluniverse]
                   :debug)
```
